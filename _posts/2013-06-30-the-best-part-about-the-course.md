title: the best part about the course

i think my summer software engineering course is excellent. i've written a
[couple][problem] [posts][busted] that may suggest otherwise, but those are
just details. if you're going to pay someone to teach you how to program,
you'll won't do better than [ut's cs373][class].

so i think the best part really has to be [the professor][gpd] though. they say
[there's a big difference][atwood] in effectiveness between the best and worst
programmers, and after 1.5 college degrees i'm starting to think the same holds
for teachers. here's some of gpd's highlights:

 - on the first day of class he gave us a hard time for being there and not at
   a summer internship. without pretense or sugar-coating, he made it clear
   that the most important part of software engineering is *doing*.

 - he gets excited about the technology we're learning. i mean programming
   would be insanely boring if you didn't enjoy it right? you're just staring
   at thousands of lines of text all day! so twice (when we learned about
   generators and callable instances) he just stopped the lecture and was all
   like "come on, are you getting excited?!!".

 - he loads the curriculum with modern tools like github and python. i think
   it's impressive that he's able to keep the tools so relevant at a massive
   university with such a rapidly evolving industry. i bet that's a lot of
   work.

i think the best part, though, is how well he explains the concepts. he's so
good at getting people to understand in class that it looks easy, but
it's not. this fact was reinforced this week when i was trying to explain some
code to the class. i think the hard part is knowing which details to omit. you
can say a lot about a single line of code, but when you're explaining it to
someone, you don't want to confuse them with too much information. so i feel
like the prof just nails this, but i stumbled all over the place trying to get
it right.

all that to say the class is great, and if the other students' weekly blog
posts are any indication, they agree. if you're a ut cs student, you should
definitely check out cs373.
