# artefactual knowledge

{% include byline %}

the professor of my software engineering course has delivered a lot of lectures
on python and sql. he does an excellent job of walking us through the
technology and asking us questions along the way that demand our attention and
keep us engaged.

i find it puzzling though, because he seems to only focus on the details of the
technology, and he doesn't really give us a high-level overview. for example we
go over every detail of built-in python data structures, but i don't think he's
ever talked about what situations would be better for python versus java. we've
explored the minutiae of various sql joins, observing several different ways to
do the same basic thing, but we don't talk about designing database schemas for
many-to-many entity relationships.

my initial reaction is that we're spending too much time on artefactual
knowledge -- the kind of trivia that's only useful if you're a python
programmer writing sql. why not talk more about high level stuff? there's two
things that keep me from thinking this is wrong:

1. he's taught this course for a long time, and everyone seems to be learning a
lot very quickly.

1. i can't imagine him talking about higher-level stuff and keeping everyone so
engaged. the fact that he calls on students throughout the lecture and they
have to answer questions about code on the projector really forces everyone to
be present.

in the end [i've been very happy with the course][best], so i'll trust
professor downing's judgement.
