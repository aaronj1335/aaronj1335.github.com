i've been posting each week this summer about my [software engineering
course][cs373] that i'm taking at ut. the final writing task is to summarize
the experience for someone considering taking the course next semester.

## the good

there's too much to put here. the course is great. just take it. here are a few
highlights:

 - you end up with a nice project you can post online
 - you get experience collaborating with others on a software project
 - the lectures demand your attention, so you end up learning the content
 - you get to know your classmates much more than typical courses
 - you get experience with a lot of relevant technologies

all of these serve to accomplish the courses main goal: getting you a job.

## the bad

it's a lot of work. you may have to deal with people you don't like. and that
will all be for nothing if you never intend to get a software development job.

## in conclusion

take the course and have fun &#9786;.
